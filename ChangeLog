	* Version 0.2.1.

	Bug fixes:

	* Fixed security vulnerability in my modifications to
	  xp_publish.php, which did not properly quote the input. It is
	  very important to install the fixed version of the file!
	* Error messages are now also printed to the console log in
	  addition to being shown in a dialog, to aid in reporting.

	* Version 0.2.

	Main changes:

	* Allow setting the description for new albums (requires an
	  additional server-side patch to the xp_publish.php file, see the
	  ReadMe).
	* Improved checking and cleanup of URLs (you can omit the http://
	  at the beginning, and properly handles a slash or "/index.php"
	  at the end).
	* Improved error checking and reporting.
	* Conversion to Latin1 encoding for proper interpretation by
	  Coppermine.
	* Populate keywords correctly (they were always set to empty).
	* Made changes to support iPhoto 5 (code by Fraser Speirs).
	* Fixed bugs in handling of repeated album and category names.
	* Other miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.
