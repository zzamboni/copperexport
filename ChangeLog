	* Version 0.5.0

	Main changes:

	* Works with iPhoto7 (part of iLife'08)
	
	* Tested on both PPC and Intel platforms.

	* Added server-side patches for Coppermine versions up to 1.4.13.

	* Fixed an old-standing bug that would prevent uploads in some
	cases, producing an HTTP 406 error (thanks to nonplus for the
	patch).

	* Version 0.4.0

	Main changes:

	* Built as a universal binary - should run in both Intel- and
 	  PPC-based Macs (I haven't tested it on Intel).
	
	* Allow saving a default resize size, which will be automatically
  	  applied to all pictures from then on.

	* Allow removing items from the list of photos to upload, directly
	  from the export dialog. This removes the photo only from the
	  upload list, not from the library (of course).

	* Reverted back to using the original filename for uploading to
	  Coppermine, rather than a generated unique ID, which was harder
	  to interpret and to handle manually on the server.
	
	* Added patches for xp_publish.php for Coppermine 1.4.3.
	
	* CopperExport now has an installer, so no manual fiddling with
	  the iPhoto plugins is necessary anymore.

	* Distribution is now in the form of a disk image.

2005-07-31  Diego Zamboni  <copperexport@zzamboni.org>

	* Version 0.3.0

	Changes:

	* Images in non-JPEG image formats are automatically converted
	  before uploading.
	* Thumbnail generation made much faster.

	(the changes above are courtesy of Fraser Speirs through FlickrExport 1.2.6.)

	* Added patches for xp_publish.php for Coppermine 1.3.3 and
	  1.4.1beta.
	* Somewhat improved error reporting (in the GUI and in the console
	  log)

	* Version 0.2.1.

	Bug fixes:

	* Fixed security vulnerability in my modifications to
	  xp_publish.php, which did not properly quote the input. It is
	  very important to install the fixed version of the file!
	* Error messages are now also printed to the console log in
	  addition to being shown in a dialog, to aid in reporting.

2005-02-04  Diego Zamboni  <copperexport@zzamboni.org>

	* Version 0.2.

	Main changes:

	* Allow setting the description for new albums (requires an
	  additional server-side patch to the xp_publish.php file, see the
	  ReadMe).
	* Improved checking and cleanup of URLs (you can omit the http://
	  at the beginning, and properly handles a slash or "/index.php"
	  at the end).
	* Improved error checking and reporting.
	* Conversion to Latin1 encoding for proper interpretation by
	  Coppermine.
	* Populate keywords correctly (they were always set to empty).
	* Made changes to support iPhoto 5 (code by Fraser Speirs).
	* Fixed bugs in handling of repeated album and category names.
	* Other miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.
